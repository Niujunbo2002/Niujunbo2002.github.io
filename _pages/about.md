Hi there üëãüëã !

My name is Junbo Niu (Áâõ‰øäÂçö), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the Department of Automation at Beihang University, pursuing a B.E. degree in Science of automation.I am currently also a research intern at Shanghai AI Lab and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jiaqi Wang, working on VLLM(Video). I will be pursuing a PhD in EECS at Peking University starting in September 2025, advised by Prof. [Bin CUI](https://cuibinpku.github.io/) and Prof. [Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/).

My research interests lie in the area of computer vision, deep learning and computer graphics. I am particularly interested in the following topics:

MLLM, e.g. Video Language Models
Image and Video Generation and Manipulation
Neural Scene Representations and Rendering

üåüüåü I'm open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email!
